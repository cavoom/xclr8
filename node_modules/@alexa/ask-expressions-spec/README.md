## Alexa Skills Kit Intermediate Representation (ASKIR).

This package contains the JSON Schema specification for the Alexa Skills Kit Intermediate Representation (ASKIR). Our schema defines two concepts: Modules and Expressions.

A _Module_ is a collection of Expressions. An _Expression_ is a data structure defining some data that is to be ingested into the SMAPI and built by Alexaâ€™s Build Platform infrastructure. Currently, Expressions are only supported by the Alexa Conversations (Coltrane) infrastructure but we envision evolving ASKIR to be the common representation for most artifacts in the Skill Package.
